        <p>There are so many ways to play Game For Peace. No matter what type of player you are, you can find a mode that suits you! If you like to play exciting games, you should play the classic mode. 100 people "fight" on a super large map, pick up equipment, run to the safe zone, and the one who survives in the end "wins the chicken dinner".</p>
        <p>If you want to experience freshness, you may play the creative workshop mode. The recall mode can revive teammates, and the dark night crisis mode lets you fight against zombies. The entertainment mode focuses on relaxation and joy. The Jedi sniper mode allows you to become a sharpshooter. There is so much fun in this game!</p>
        <p>There is also a team competition mode suitable for teaming up with good brothers to "play black". The special training island mode is like a super large game park. Practice shooting and play small games. There is always one that can touch your heart!</p>
