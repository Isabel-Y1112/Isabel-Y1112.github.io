        <h1>Exploring Minecraft Gameplay Modes</h1>
        <p>In survival mode, players start with nothing and must gather resources like wood, stone, and food. They need to
            build shelters to protect themselves from monsters that come out at night. For example, zombies, skeletons,
            and creepers pose a threat to the player's survival.
            <br>
            Creative mode, on the other hand, is all about unleashing your creativity. Players have access to an
            unlimited supply of all blocks and can fly, allowing them to build massive structures, cities, and even
            entire worlds.
            <br>
            Adventure mode is designed for playing custom maps created by other players. It restricts the player's ability
            to break blocks, adding an extra layer of challenge and exploration.</p>
