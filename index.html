    <p>After Ne Zha and Ao Bing are struck by heavenly lightning together, their physical bodies are destroyed.[a] To prevent their souls from dissipating, Master Taiyi Zhenren exhausts his Seven-Colored Sacred Lotus to regenerate their physical bodies, though they are still fragile. Ao Bing's father, Ao Guang, the Dragon King of the East Sea, believing his son is dead, orders Master Shen Gongbao to attack Chentang Pass with the demons imprisoned under his palace and the other three Dragon Kings of the Four Seas. Ao Bing defends Chentang Pass, but his new body disintegrates due to the effort exerted. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_Zha_2)</p>
    <p>I like Nezha 2 because while it is very funny and contains stunning animation, the characters are well-developed, blending humor and emotional depth. Its themes of defiance and redemption resonate powerfully, making it both entertaining and meaningful. (This content was created with the help of A.I.)</p>
