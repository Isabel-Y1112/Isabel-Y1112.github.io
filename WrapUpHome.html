        <h1>Minecraft: Where Imagination Comes to Life</h1>
        <p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. It was first released in 2011 and has since
            gained a massive global following. In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally - generated 3D world
            with virtually infinite terrain and can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build
            structures, earthworks, and simple machines. The game's open - ended nature allows players to create and
            experience the game in their own unique ways.</p>
